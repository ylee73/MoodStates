## Simple State Machine with Splash + Opening
#### by Ashley Lee


### Overview
This is an application of the Simple State Machine template using five mood pngs with an opening and splash state.


### Modifying the Template

(1) Add your own PNG files in the assets folder. Make sure they match the names ***exactly*** of the existing PNGs.

(2) Add custom drawing code to drawOne(), drawTwo(), drawThree(), drawFour(), drawFive()

(3) You can add your own interfaces - keys, mouse events, etc in the Interfaces section

Don't change anything else! 

### How it works
